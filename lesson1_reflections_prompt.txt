How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pin-pointed the difference without us actually manually browing through
    the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can easily keep track of what was changed in any version of the file
    and whether we need to carry it forward or might want to revert back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    gives lots of flexibility in commiting at a logical point

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because files may have dependencies

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can find out whether some edits were made to the files or not

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can check every committed version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
